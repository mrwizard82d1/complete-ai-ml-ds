- What is "Machine Learning"?
	- Use a machine to predict results based on input
- Machine learning categories
	- Supervised
		- Classification
			- Requires "labeled data"
		- Regression
	- Unsupervised
		- Clustering - **no** labeled data
			- Categories created by machine
		- Associate rule learning
	- Reinforcement
		- Tries to maximize "the score"
		- Skill acquisition
		- Real-time learning
