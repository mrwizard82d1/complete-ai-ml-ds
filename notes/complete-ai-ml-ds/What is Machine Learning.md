- Computers are good at certain things
	- Fast
	- Can control the tasks of computers
- Example: find route to Daniel's house
	- Measure each route and a map and find shortest
		- Single problem solution
	- Program computer to find the shortest route (between **any** two points)
		- Generalized approach
- Computers good at solving problems with
	- Well-defined rules
	- Not good at problems like
		- Is this person angry?
		- Is this picture a cat?
	- General strategy: separate problems
- Machine learning changes problem solving decision
- Goal
	- Machines act more and more "like humans"
