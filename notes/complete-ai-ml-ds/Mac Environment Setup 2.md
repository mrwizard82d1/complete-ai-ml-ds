Oops! Missed installing `jupyter` (notebook)
- Simple solution: run `conda install jupyter`

Can now run `jupyter lab`
- Opens a notebook in a browser

Verify loading of typical modules
- `import pandas as pd`
- `import numpy as np`
- `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- `import sklearn`

Our environment is now configured with our required packages

When finished for the day, shutdown notebook
- And `conda deactivate` the environment
