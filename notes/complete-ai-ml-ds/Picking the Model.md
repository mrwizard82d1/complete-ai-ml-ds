- Modeling part 2: choosing and training a model
- Our focus: **choosing**
- Initial problem
	- What kind of ML algorithms to use with what kinds of problems?
- Generally...
	- Structured data
		- CatBoost
		- XGBoost
		- Random Forest
	- Unstructured data
		- Deep Learning (neural networks)
		- Transfer Learning
- Training a model
	- Main goal
		- Align "inputs" and "outputs"
	- We want to:
		- Use "feature variables" to predict "target variables"
		- Similarly, use X (data) to predict y (labels)
	- Always uses **training data**
- Goal: minimize times between experiments
	- Sometimes may start with subset of training set
	- May want to use a **simpler model** 
	- Remember that machine learning is **highly iterative**
- Things to remember
	- Some models work better that others on different problems
	- Don't be afraid to try things
	- Start small and build up (add complexity) as needed
