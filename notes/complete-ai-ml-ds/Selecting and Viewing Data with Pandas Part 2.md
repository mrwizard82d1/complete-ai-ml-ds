Only scratching the surface of selecting and viewing data
- `crosstab()
	- A great way to compare two columns
- `groupby()`
	- Allows one to group elements in one or more columns (the default) of a `DataFrame`
	- Similar to `crosstab()` but allows one to focus on **more than one column** at a time
- `plot()`
	- Plot all the (numeric) values in a column of a `DataFrame` (y-axis) against the **index** values (x-axis)
		- Used to quickly understand the data
		- If plot does not appear, one may need to:
			- Execute two commands (at the top of the notebook)
				- `%matplotlib inline`
				- `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- `hist()`
	- Plots a histogram of the values in the specified column
	- Quickly allows one to assess the "shape" of data
		- And perhaps determine "outliers"
- Researching a type problem
	- Enter the expression, `car_sales['Price'].plot()`
		- This action results in a `TypeError` exception. The detailed message is 'no numeric data to plot'
	- We investigate the "type" of this expression
		- `car_sales['Price'].dtype`
		- Returns `dtype('O') (an **object** type)
	- Search "How to convert a pandas price column to an integer"
	- Note that some changes have apparently occurred in the `replace()` function since this video was "cut"
