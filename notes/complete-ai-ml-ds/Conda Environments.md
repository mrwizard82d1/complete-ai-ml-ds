Critical to get environment set up to work effectively

An environment contains
- A project folder
	- Data to be used
	- For example, patient data
- A conda environment with appropriate packages and tools
	- For example,
		- `pandas`
		- `numpy`
		- `matplotlib`
		- `scikit-learn`

May not seem useful when working by yourself
- But critical when working on a team
- Sharing environments and tools
