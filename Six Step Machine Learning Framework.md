- A framework to address different kinds of problems
	- A [field guide](https://www.mrdbourke.com/a-6-step-field-guide-for-building-machine-learning-projects/)
- Six steps
	1. Problem definition
	2. Data
	3. Evaluation
	4. Features
	5. Modelling
	6. Experiments
- Problem definition
	- "What problem are we trying to solve?"
		- Supervised vs. unsupervised
		- Classification
		- Regression
- Data
	- A requirements for **all** machine learning problems 
	- "What kind of data do we have"
		- Structured
			- Rows and columns
			- Spreadsheet
		- Unstructured
			- Images
			- Audio
- Evaluation
	- "What defines success for us?"
	- Can "get caught" trying to find "perfect" model
	- Example: 
		- Success: 95% accuracy in predicting real estate prices
- Features
	- "What do we already know about the data?"
		- Examples
			- Bodyweight to predict heart disease
				- A numerical feature
	- Kinds of features
		- Numerical
		- Categorical
		- Derived
	- Goal:
		- Turn features into patterns to make predictions
- Modeling
	- "Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?"
	- Most **already** coded
	- Our initial focus
		- Find the right model for **my** problem
- Experimentation
	- "How could we improve? What can we try next?"
	- Many attempts; that is, **iterative**
	- Ask question after each attempt
