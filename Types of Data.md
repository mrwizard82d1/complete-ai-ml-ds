- What kind of data do we have?
- Different types
	- Structured data
		- Excel
		- CSV
		- All samples have similar format
		- All columns have same "type"
	- Unstructured data
		- Images
		- Natural language text
		- Video
		- Audio
		- Many varying formats
			- Different pictures of dogs
			- Email
	- Static data
		- CSV (to `DataFrame`)
		- "Static" because format does not change over time
	- Streaming data
		- Changes (constantly) **with time**
		- News headlines
- Often move from static data initially to streaming data
- Key idea
	- More data => more opportunities to find patterns
- Data science workflow
	- Open CSV file in Jupyter notebook
	- Explore data and perform **data analysis** using `pandas`
		- Create **derived** `DataFrame`s
	- Visualize data using `matplotlib`
		- Exploring / visualizing feed off each other
	- Build machine learning models on data using `sci-kit.learn`
		- For example, producing a model to predict heart disease
