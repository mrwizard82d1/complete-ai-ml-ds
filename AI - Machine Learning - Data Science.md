	- AI but only for a single (small number of) domain
- "General AI"
	- Generally mimicking human behavior

Machine learning
- A subset of AI
- Getting machines to accomplish tasks without specifically programming them for a specific task

Deep learning
- A type of algorithm used to implement machine learning

Data Science
- Analyzing data to achieve (business) goal
- Overlaps with AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- But neither a subset nor a superset

Focus of course
