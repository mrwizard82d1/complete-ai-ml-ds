- "What defines success **for us**?"
	- For example,
		- For this project to be worth pursuing further
		- We need a machine learning model with 
		- Over 99% accuracy
- Different metrics for different kinds of problems
	- Classification
		- Accuracy
		- Precision
		- Recall
	- Regression
		- Mean absolute error (MAE)
		- Mean squared error (MSE)
		- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
	- Recommendation
		- Precision at K
- Defining metrics at beginning of project
	- Provides everyone with common goal
	- But remember, project metrics **may change**
- What do you measure?
