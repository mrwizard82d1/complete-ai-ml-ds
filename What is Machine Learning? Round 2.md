- Broad
	- Contains many different aspects
- Our definition
	- Using an (machine learning) algorithm or computer program
	- To learn about different patterns in data
	- And then using that algorithm to make predictions about future (unseen), similar data
- Machine learning algorithms are also called **models**
	- We use this terminology throughout the course
- Difference between typical algorithms and machine learning algorithms
	- Typical algorithms are a set of instructions to move input to output
		- For example,
			1. Cut vegetables
			2. Season chicken
			3. Preheat oven
			4. Cook chicken for 30-minutes
			5. Add vegetables
	- Typical machine learning algorithms
		- Start with inputs and "matching" outputs
		- Try to determine the set of **instructions**
		- Requires iterations
			- Not a few
			- But **many** (thousands or more)
- What about "data analysis" and "data science"
	- "Data analysis" is
		- Looking at a set of data
		- By comparing different examples
			- For example, look at ingredients and ask questions
	- "Data science" is
		- Running **experiments** on a set of data with the hopes of finding actionable insights
			- One experiment **might be**
				- Build a machine learning model
- Consider
	- Data science
	- Data analysis
	- As a **part of** machine learning
