- Modeling part 3
	- Tuning
	- Trying to improve the results from the **training data**
- Tuning a model
	- May re-use training data but...
	- For example,
		- Cooking chicken at 180 C versus
		- Cooking chicken at 200 C
	- Examples
		- Number of trees in a random forest
		- Number of layers in neural network
- Things to remember
	- Machine learning models have **hyperparameters**
		- One can adjust these hyperparameters to improve the model performance
	- A model's first results **are not** its last
	- Tuning can take place on
		- Training data sets
		- Validation data sets
			- When?
