- Different kinds of variables
	- Numerical - a number
	- Categorical - one of a number of sets
	- Derived - calculated from other variables
		- Again, can be
			- Categorical
			- Numerical
	- "Feature engineering"
- Machine learning can identify a feature
	- Without defining the feature ahead of time
- Missing data
	- Imagine "Most eaten food" column
	- But only filled in partially (less than 10%)
	- We **want** > 10% coverage to apply machine learning
