- Question: "What do we already know about the data?"
- What does "feature" mean?
	- A synonym for different forms of data **within**
		- Structured data
		- Unstructured data
	- Example
		- Patient records
			- Weight
			- Sex
			- Heart Rate
			- Chest Pain
		- AKA, "feature variables"
- Different kinds of feature variables
	- Numerical - a number
	- Categorical - one of a number of sets
	- Derived - calculated from other variables
		- Again, can be
			- Categorical
			- Numerical
	- "Feature engineering"
		- The process of defining "features" out of data
- Machine learning can identify a feature
	- Without defining the feature ahead of time
- Missing data can compromise our goal
	- Imagine "Most eaten food" column
	- But only filled in partially (less than 10%)
	- We **want** > 10% coverage to apply machine learning
	- Called "Feature coverage"
