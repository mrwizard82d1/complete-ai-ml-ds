Taking the world "by storm"

Computers are machines that are:
- Really good at doing repetitive tasks really, really fast
- For example,
	- H2 calculate the shortest route to Daniel's house?
		- One way: manually
			- Get a map
			- Identify a route
			- Calculate the distance
			- Choose a route with shortest route
		- Computer
			- Program to find shortest path
			- For example,
				- Candidate route is minimum of "route 1" and "route 2"
				- Loop over all remaining routes
					- Candidate route is minimum of current minimum and "route n"
				- Candidate route is the minimum

Not all tasks amenable to a deterministic algorithm

The buzzword: machine learning
- Allow computers to act more like humans
- **Warning**: The answer returned my a machine learning algorithm is **probabilistic**
