- But first... Why should you **not** use machine learning?
	- Will a simple, hand-coded instruction based system work?
- Main types of machine learning
	- Key to match type of machine learning to business problem
	- Match business
	- Supervised learning
	- Unsupervised learning
	- Transfer learning
	- Reinforcement learning
	- Focus on first three
		- Have proven track record
- Supervised learning
	- Have data and labels ("already")
	- Algorithm attempts to predict label from data
		- If prediction "bad", algorithm "learns"
	- Classification
		- "One thing or another"
		- Binary - only two options
			- Example: heart disease or no heart disease
		- Multi-class - more than two options
			- Dog breeds from pictures
	- Regression
		- Trying to predict a number
		- Continuous
		- Examples
			- Predict the sale price of a house
			- Predict sales of app to be launched
- Unsupervised learning
	- Data but **no** labels
	- Example:
		- Who's interested in summer clothes?
	- Labels applied **after** learning
		- Note: **You** provide the labels
	- Types
		- Clustering
		- Recommendations
- Transfer learning
	- Leverages an existing model 
	- Fine tune model for your specific problem
	- Example
		- Start with system that identifies car models
		- Fine tune model to recognize dog breeds
			- (May be a bit too far afield - I don't know)
- Reinforcement learning
	- Rewards program for doing well; punish for doing poorly
	- Requires a "defined space"
	- Example
		- Playing chess
		- DeepMinds training in Go
		- Still in "early phase"
			- So will not focus on this type of learning
- Matching your problem
	- "I know my inputs and outputs"
		- Classification
		- Regression
	- "I have inputs but I'm not sure of outputs"
		- Unsupervised learning
	- "I think my problem is similar to something else"
		- Transfer learning
