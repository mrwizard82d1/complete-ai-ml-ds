- Modeling Part 1 (3 sets)
	- The most important part of the course
- 3 parts
	- Choosing and training a model
	- Tuning
	- Model comparison
- The most important concept in machine learning
	- Test splits or sets (3 sets)
		- Training
		- Validation
		- Test
	- How to mitigate the risk that our model fails in the real world
		- Split existing data into three parts
	- Why?
		- Course materials (training set)
		- Practice exam (validation set)
		- Final exam (test set)
- The success of **all** models is based an **generalization**
	- The ability of a machine learning model to perform well on data it **has not seen before**
- When things go wrong?
	- For example, practice exam is **same** as final exam
		- Many students get really good marks
		- But indeterminate if students have learned material
- Splitting data
	- Training split (70-80% of available data)
	- Validation split (10-15% of available data)
	- Test split (10-15% of available data)
	- In some scenarios, you **may not have a validation split**
	- Validation split allows one to improve model by
		- Tuning
	- Test split allows a "final test" to
		- Verify that goals are achieved
